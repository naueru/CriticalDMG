# criticaldmg - Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

## Getting started

You can run this project with docker without installing any dependencies, only [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
```
docker-compose build
```
and
```
docker-compose up
```
This last commands start the server in the port set on the .env file. 
This docker configuration is intended to be temporal, as this is a POC we don't want to install dependencies on our computer that we don't know if we're going to use. In any case if we choose to work based on this prototype we can work to improve our docker configuration or just install the dependencies.

## Original Getting Started 

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and mongo installed.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/criticaldmg
    npm install
    ```
3. Install and configure Mongo
4. Set Mongo variables on the code
5. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g @feathersjs/cli          # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
